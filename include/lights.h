 * The light algorithm implemented on this project is called The Phong
 * Reflection Model, named by its creator Bui Tuong Phong. It simulates
 * the interaction between three light sources. They are: ambient reflection,
 * diffuse reflection and specular reflection. In other words, respectively,
 * background light, the light reflected from a matte surface and the
 * reflection of the source light itself. The last one, depends only on the
 * angle between the reflection vector and the eye vector and is controlled
 * by a parameter that's called shininess. The higher the shininess, the
 * smaller and tigher the specular highlight is.
